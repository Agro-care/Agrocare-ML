<h2>Agro-Assist ML</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Throughout the project, we have used various machine learning models to develop the key features of the application, i.e., </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Crop Type Recommendation System</li>
    <li>Fertilizer Recommendation System</li>
    <li>Crop Disease Identification System</li>
  </ul>
  <li>The models gave accurate results, i.e., predictions and recommendations while testing them.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ML Models</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Crop Type Recommendation System - Random Forest Classifier</li>
    <li>Fertilizer Recommendation System - Random Forest Classifier</li>
    <li>Crop Disease Identification System - ResNet18 (CNN)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Django API</h3>
<ul>
  <li>After developing the suitable ML models for the features, integrated the models in with the Django APPs to generate the API links.</li>
  <li>Through the obtained API links, we devoloped the inter communication between the frontend components and the Model.</li>
  <li>Giving the appropriate details from the frontend, the django app in the backend will run the model and respond with a prediction or recommendation.</li>
</ul>
